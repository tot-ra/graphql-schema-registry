Graphql schema storage as dockerized on-premise service for federated graphql gateway server
(based on [apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/)) as alternative to [Apollo studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/)

## Features

- Stores versioned schema for graphql-federated services
- Serves schema for graphql gateway based on provided services & their versions
- Validates new schema to be compatible with other _running_ services
- Provides UI for developers to see stored schema & its history diff
- Stores & shows in UI persisted queries passed by the gateway for debugging
- Stores service urls emulating managed federation: you no longer need to hardcode the services in your gateway's constructor, or rely on an additonal service (etcd, consul) for service discovery
- Async schema registration of new schema with events to avoid polling (`schema-registry -> kafka -> gateway`)

## Roadmap

(Pull requests are encouraged on these topics)

- Usage tracking (to avoid breaking changes) - needs a separate docker sub-process in golang
  - registered clients (based on headers, including apollo-\* ones)
  - schema usage breakdown by multiple facets - property, day, query name, client name
  - fixed data retention
- schema linting rules (camelCase, mandatory descriptions, too big objects, inconsistent pagination, dates not in DateTime...)
  - integrate [inspector](https://graphql-inspector.com/docs/essentials/diff)
- Performance tracking (to know what resolvers to optimize)
- access control - lightweight authentication in case this internal tool is publicly accessible
- separate ephemeral automatic PQs, registered by frontend (use cache only with TTL) from true PQs backend-registered persisted queries (use DB only)

## Configuration

We use environment variables for configuration.
You can:

- pass them directly
- add .env file and dotenv will pick them up
- add them to `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile`

The following are the different environment variables that are looked up that allow configuring the schema registry in different ways.

| Variable Name         | Description                                                                   | Default                   |

For development we rely on docker network and use hostnames from `docker-compose.yml`.
Node service uses to connect to mysql & redis and change it if you install it with own setup.
For dynamic service discovery (if you need multiple hosts for scaling), override `app/config.js` and `diplomat.js`

## Installation

With default settings, UI should be accessible at [http://localhost:6001](http://localhost:6001)

### On bare host

```
git clone https://github.com/pipedrive/graphql-schema-registry.git && cd graphql-schema-registry
cp example.env .env && nano .env
node app/schema-registry.js
```

### Docker image

We have [docker image published](https://hub.docker.com/r/pipedrive/graphql-schema-registry/tags) for main node service.
It assumes you have mysql/redis running separately.
Use exact IP instead of `localhost`.
Use exact docker image tag to avoid breaking changes.

```
docker pull pipedrive/graphql-schema-registry:3.0.1
docker run -e DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_USERNAME=root -e DB_PORT=6000 -p 6001:3000 pipedrive/graphql-schema-registry
```

### Docker-compose

```
git clone https://github.com/pipedrive/graphql-schema-registry.git && cd graphql-schema-registry
docker-compose up
```

## Use cases

### Validating schema on deploy

On pre-commit / deploy make a POST /schema/validate to see if its compatible with current schema.

### Schema registration

On service start-up (runtime), make POST to /schema/push to register schema (see API reference for details).
Make sure to handle failure.

See [example](examples/schema_registration_client/index.js) for nodejs/ESM.

### Schema migration

If service A contains schema that needs to be migrated to service B, we need to orchestrate schema & traffic change.
Instead of juggling with schema status flags, we suggest the following scenario:

- service B gets deployed with new schema which includes cycle of attempts to register new schema (for example every 5 sec).
- schema-registry responds with validation errors
- service A without conflicting schema gets deployed & updates schema-registry
- service B manages to register new schema & stops the cycle

## Architecture

### Tech stack

| Frontend (`/client` folder) | Backend (`/app` folder)           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| react                       | nodejs 14                         |
| apollo client               | express, hapi/joi                 |
| styled-components           | apollo-server-express, dataloader |
|                             | redis 6                           |
|                             | knex                              |
|                             | mysql 8                           |

### Components

graphql-schema-registry service is one of the components for graphql federation, but it needs tight
integration with gateway. Check out [examples folder](examples/README.md) on how to implement it. Note however, that
gateway is very simplified and does not have proper error handling, cost limits or fail-safe mechanisms.

In gateway, you may also find useful our [graphql-query-cost](https://github.com/pipedrive/graphql-query-cost) library too. Check it out

### DB structure

Migrations are done using knex

## Development

### Dockerized mode

```
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Running in light mode

To have fast iteration of working on UI changes, you can avoid running node service in docker, and run only mysql & redis

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.light.yml up
npm run develop
```

### DB migrations

To create new DB migration, use:

```bash
npm run new-db-migration
```

If not using the default configuration of executing DB migrations on service startup, you can run the following `npm`
command prior to starting the registry:

```bash
npm run migrate-db
```

The command can be prefixed with any environment variable necessary to configure DB connection (in case you ALTER DB with another user), such as:

```bash
DB_HOST=my-db-host DB_PORT=6000 npm run migrate-db
```

## Testing

Unit tests use jest, coverage is quite low as most logic is in db or libraries.

```
npm run test
```

Functional tests require docker, mostly blackbox type - real http requests are done against containers.
DB tables are truncated after every test from within `test/functional/bootstrap.js`
Jest runs in single worker mode to avoid tests from affecting each other due to same state.

```
npm run test-functional
```

## Rest API documentation

### GET /schema/latest

Simplified version of /schema/compose where latest versions from different services is composed. Needed mostly for debugging

### POST /schema/compose

Lists schema based on passed services & their versions.
Used by graphql gateway to fetch schema based on current containers

#### Request params (optional, raw body)

```json
{
  "services": [
    { "name": "service_a", "version": "ke9j34fuuei" },
    { "name": "service_b", "version": "e302fj38fj3" }
  ]
}
```

#### Response example

- ✅ 200

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "service_id": 3,
      "version": "ke9j34fuuei",
      "name": "service_a",
      "url": "http://localhost:6111",
      "added_time": "2020-12-11T11:59:40.000Z",
      "type_defs": "\n\ttype Query {\n\t\thello: String\n\t}\n",
      "is_active": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "service_id": 4,
      "version": "v1",
      "name": "service_b",
      "url": "http://localhost:6112",
      "added_time": "2020-12-14T18:51:04.000Z",
      "type_defs": "type Query {\n  world: String\n}\n",
      "is_active": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

- ❌ 400 "services[0].version" must be a string
- ❌ 500 Internal error (DB is down)

#### Request params

- services{ name, version}

If `services` is not passed, schema-registry tries to find most recent versions. Logic behind the scenes is that schema with _highest_ `added_time` OR `updated_time` is picked as latest. If time is the same, `schema.id` is used.

### POST /schema/push

Validates and registers new schema for a service.

#### Request params (optional, raw body)

```json
{
  "name": "service_a",
  "version": "ke9j34fuuei",
  "type_defs": "\n\ttype Query {\n\t\thello: String\n\t}\n"
}
```

URL is optional if you use urls from schema-registry as service discovery

```json
{
  "name": "service_b",
  "version": "jiaj51fu91k",
  "type_defs": "\n\ttype Query {\n\t\tworld: String\n\t}\n",
  "url": "http://service-b.develop.svc.cluster.local"
}
```

#### POST /schema/validate

Validates schema, without adding to DB

##### Request params (raw body)

- name
- version
- type_defs

#### POST /schema/diff

Compares schemas and finds breaking or dangerous changes between provided and latest schemas.

- name
- version
- type_defs

#### DELETE /schema/:schemaId

##### Request params

| Property | Type   | Comments        |
| -------- | ------ | --------------- |

#### GET /persisted_query

Looks up persisted query from DB & caches it in redis if its found

##### Request params (query)

| Property | Type   | Comments                         |
