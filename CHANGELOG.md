## [Unreleased]

## [5.5.1] 2023-01-29
### Changed
Security updates of knex and body-parser dependencies

## [5.5.0] 2023-01-29
### Changed
Redis dependency is now optional and password-protected

- Passing the Redis password to the RedisTransport constructor in src/logger.ts.
- Initializing Redis in the init() function in src/index.ts. With this change the warnings in the logs disappear.
- In order to cover the Redis/password cases, the docker-compose.base.yml now makes sure to launch Redis with password protection.
- Adding an environment variable called LOG_STREAMING_ENABLED to further control if log streaming over Redis should be enabled or not.

## [5.4.0] 2022-10-27
### Changed
- Add schema normalization (re-formatting) - this should get rid of extra tabbing & spacing when services register their schemas inconsistently
- Fix knex migration generation from commandline (`npm run new-db-migration my-new-migration`)
- Improve migration scripts to support JS migrations. Possibly somewhat breaking change for organizations that relied only on .sql files
- Migrate schemas to now include UUID (js migration). If your organization didn't expect/run js migrations, you will have empty UUIDs, but follow-up schema registrations should have it in new schemas, so not a big deal, just may be a bit confusing in the UI
- Do not delete duplicate schemas as its a bit dangerous. You may have had duplicate schemas before. We could have deleted them, but its a risky operation.

If you need to clean them up, here is a script:
```sql
UPDATE `container_schema` t3
  INNER JOIN `schema` t1
  INNER JOIN `schema` t2
  SET t3.schema_id = t1.id
  WHERE t1.UUID IS NOT null
    AND t1.id < t2.id
    AND t1.UUID = t2.UUID
    AND t3.schema_id = t2.id;

DELETE t2
  FROM `schema` t1
  INNER JOIN `schema` t2
  WHERE
    t2.UUID IS NOT null AND
    t1.id < t2.id AND
    t1.UUID = t2.UUID;
```

## [5.0.0] 2022-09-27

### Breaking Changes

- apollo federation v2 is used within schema validation.
  You need to follow the [migration guide by apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-2/moving-to-federation-2/), upgrade gateway and may need to change subgraph schemas
- apollo composition library [migrated from MIT license to ELv2](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/moving-apollo-federation-2-to-the-elastic-license-v2/), which [adds limitations on how you can use it](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/main/LICENSE#L22), which does not affect graphql-schema-registry source code as we only reference it (and its up to you, client, to install and use the library), but docker image _is affected_ as it bundles/distributes the library.

Basically you cannot use graphql-schema-registry docker image to commercially compete with Apollo Studio, otherwise its fine to use as internal tool. If you feel this is unfair, feel free to create PR with alternative/pluggable schema validation method.

## [4.0.0] - 2022-07-17

### Added

- **New Feature - schema usage**
  - New DB migration adds `clients`, `clients_persisted_queries_rel` and `schema_hit` tables
  - Async workrer which analyzes graphql queries and maps them onto schemas to generate schema hits (usage), see `src/worker` and also `examples` for more details. As this requires manual setup, released as major version.
  - graphql schemas & resolvers to provide schema usage
  - UI to see schema usage tab (under specific service schema)
    - Added rumble-charts dependency to draw graphs
  - UI - renamed schemas -> services in menu & added counter
- Added redlock dependency - it now locks schema registration for some time in case multiple instances of new service try to register same schema & overload the DB. Now only one instance gets access and others wait
- Tooling
  - added integration tests, mostly useful for worker testing as its async

### Updated

- async-redis -> ioredis
- docker-compose files are not simpler and more composeable

## [3.5.0] - 2022-07-14

### Updated

- knex major version bump 0.20.2 -> 2.1.0

## [3.4.0] - 2022-06-07

### Updated

- nodejs version 14 -> 16

## [3.3.0] - 2022-05-25

### Updated

- /schema/latest now does not have schema validation, because we expect schema to be validated
  during /schema/push. This is performance improvement
- added performance tests. Mean duration for simple schema perf test ~ 660 ms (dockerized, your experience may differ)

## [3.2.3] - 2022-05-25

### Fixed

- /schema/push now returns 400 instead of 500 if you attempt to register service schema with same version
- note, that you can register schema from multiple pods if it is the same (type definitions are matched)

## [3.2.2] - 2022-05-24

### Updated

- Fonts in diff & definition tabs are now monospace & same size
- Added support for use `TypeScript` in the client side code. A pair of components were converted to TypeScript to validate the configuration.
- Added the configuration for `testing-library/react` and `testing-library/react-hooks`, so unit tests could be added to the client side code. A pair of tests were added to validate the configuration.
- `eslint-webpack-plugin` was added to avoid forgetting to fix eslint and prettier issues during development.
- Some commands on Dockerfiles were rewritten to benefit from caching when executing `npm install`

## [3.2.1] - 2022-05-14

### Updated

- Added react-refresh-webpack-plugin. It only executes in development mode: its setup is conditionally imported in server side, so its inclusion is omitted in production mode.
- For the setup of the previous one, I've had to wrap all the server setup in a async function to make the conditional import works. It doesn't affect to any functionality.
- Added source map loading for node_modules libraries.
- Removed some unused dependencies.

## [3.2.0] - 2022-05-05

### Updated

- `eslint` libraries were being listed as dependencies but not config was set. So an eslint config was added.
- Same thing with `prettier`, it was listed as a dependency and executed on commit (not configured for ts files though) but some files were not formatted with it.
- Some unused dependencies were removed from both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.
- Removed react-hot-loader because it was not proper configured. I have already a working version with [react-refresh-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin) planned for a future PR.
- Some libraries (mostly for the frontend part compilation) were upgrades in order to `improve` the generation of the bundle.
- Some `general cleanup`: removed unused imports, unused declarations, etc.

## [3.1.0] - 2022-05-05

### Added

- Added dependency to winston
- Added an instance of logger in logger.ts and removed the logging functions
- Replace every use of the previous logger functions with calls to the logger exposed from logger.ts

### Fixed

- npm lock version 2
- graphql & @apollo/federation version compatibility
- mysql2 & knex version compatibility
- npm audit issues

## [3.0.1] - 2022-02-08

## [2.2.0] - 2021-11-23

### Added

- New feature - asynchroneous notification of gateway via kafka to avoid polling & reduce schema inconsistency time. See [examples/gateway_service_kafka_notification] for gateway. Use env vars to configure schema-registry
